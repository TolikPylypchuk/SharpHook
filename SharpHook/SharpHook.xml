            <value>The delay between simulating individual characters when simulating text on Linux.</value>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            X11 doesn't support simulating arbitrary Unicode characters directly. Instead, for each character,
            an unused key code is remapped to that character, and then key press/release is simulated. Since the receiving
            application must react to the remapping, and may not do so instantaneously, a delay is needed for accurate
            simulation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The default delay is 50 milliseconds.

            <para>
            The text to simulate doesn't depend on the current keyboard layout. The full range of UTF-16 (including
            surrogate pairs, e.g. emojis) is supported.
            </para>
            <para>
            On Windows text simulation should work correctly and consistently.
            </para>
            <para>
            On macOS applications are not required to process text simulation, but most of them should handle it correctly.

            <para>
            X11 doesn't support text simulation directly. Instead, for each character, an unused key code is remapped to
            that character, and then key press/release is simulated. Since the receiving application must react to the
            remapping, and may not do so instantaneously, a delay is needed for accurate simulation. This means that text
            simulation on Linux works slowly and is not guaranteed to be correct. <see cref="P:SharpHook.EventSimulator.TextSimulationDelayOnX11" />
            can be used to increase (or decrease) the delay if needed - longer delays add consistency but may be more
            jarring to end users. <see cref="P:SharpHook.EventSimulator.TextSimulationDelayOnX11" /> can also be used to get the currently configured
            delay - the default is 50 milliseconds.

            X11 doesn't support text simulation directly. Instead, for each character, an unused key code is remapped to

            </para>
            <para>
            X11 doesn't support text simulation directly. Instead, for each character, an unused key code is remapped to
            that character, and then key press/release is simulated. Since the receiving application must react to the
            remapping, and may not do so instantaneously, a delay is needed for accurate simulation. This means that text
            simulation on Linux works slowly and is not guaranteed to be correct. <see cref="M:SharpHook.Native.UioHook.SetPostTextDelayX11(System.UInt64)" /> can be
            used to increase (or decrease) the delay if needed - longer dealys add consistency but may be more jarring to
            end users. <see cref="M:SharpHook.Native.UioHook.GetPostTextDelayX11" /> can be used to get the currently configured delay - the default is

            X11 doesn't support text simulation directly. Instead, for each character, an unused key code is remapped to
            that character, and then key press/release is simulated. Since the receiving application must react to the
            remapping, and may not do so instantaneously, a delay is needed for accurate simulation. This means that text
            entry on Linux works slowly and is not guaranteed to be correct. <see cref="M:SharpHook.Providers.IEventSimulationProvider.SetPostTextDelayX11(System.UInt64)" /> can be used
            to increase (or decrease) the delay if needed - longer delays add consistency but may be more jarring to end
