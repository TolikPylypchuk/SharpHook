<h1 id="about-sharphook">About SharpHook</h1>

<p>SharpHook - created by <a href="https://tolik.io">Tolik Pylypchuk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="library-status">Library Status</h2>
<p>If you've noticed that this library hasn't gotten new commits in some time, rest assured that it's not abandoned!
I'm not giving up on this library any time soon.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building from Source</h2>
<p>In order to build this library, you'll first need to get libuiohook binaries. You you can get a
<a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook/actions/workflows/build.yml">nightly build from this repository</a>, or you
can build them yourself as instructed in the <a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/libuiohook">libuiohook fork</a> that
SharpHook uses (not recommended as it's non-trivial, and you should most probably use the same options that the build in
this repository uses anyway).</p>
<p>Place the binaries into the appropriate directories in the <code>SharpHook</code> project, as described in the following table:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>OS</th>
    <th>File</th>
    <th>Source directory</th>
    <th>Target directory</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Windows</th>
    <td>uiohook.dll</td>
    <td>windows/&lt;platform&gt;/bin</td>
    <td>lib/win-&lt;platform&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>macOS</th>
    <td>libuiohook.dylib</td>
    <td>darwin/&lt;platform&gt;/lib</td>
    <td>lib/osx-&lt;platform&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Mac Catalyst</th>
    <td>libuiohook.dylib</td>
    <td>catalyst/&lt;platform&gt;/lib</td>
    <td>lib/maccatalyst-&lt;platform&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Linux</th>
    <td>libuiohook.so</td>
    <td>linux/&lt;platform&gt;/lib</td>
    <td>lib/linux-&lt;platform&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>With libuiohook in place you can build SharpHook using your usual methods, e.g. with Visual Studio or the <code>dotnet</code> CLI.
You need .NET 9 to build SharpHook.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
<h3 id="v600-may-18-2025"><a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook/releases/tag/v6.0.0">v6.0.0</a> (May 18, 2025)</h3>
<h4 id="platform-support">Platform Support</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for Mac Catalyst on non-MAUI applications was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minimum .NET Framework version was bumped to 4.7.2. Direct support for .NET 6 and 7 was removed, but it's still
available through .NET Standard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>All structs and enums were moved from <code>SharpHook.Native</code> to <code>SharpHook.Data</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ModifierMask</code> and <code>EventReservedValueMask</code> were merged into a single enum - <code>EventMask</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>UioHookEvent.Reserved</code> was removed. Its values are now part of <code>UioHookEvent.Mask</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All constructors of <code>SimpleGlobalHook</code>, <code>TaskPoolGlobalHook</code>, <code>SimpleReactiveGlobalHook</code>, and
<code>ReactiveGlobalHookAdapter</code> except the main ones were removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TaskPoolGlobalHookOptions</code> was removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All obsolete values in the <code>KeyCode</code> enum were removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>LogSource.Register</code> was removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Members of <code>HookException</code> related to binary formatters were removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The behaviour of <code>TestGlobalHook</code> and <code>TestProvider</code> was changed. Instead of dispatching events in the same thread
that simulates them, they now instead add events into an event loop running on a different thread.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TestProvider</code> now throws an exception if <code>Run</code> or <code>RunAsync</code> is called and it's already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The ability to stop global hooks without disposing of them was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several functions for working with the macOS Accessibility API were added.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>UioHookEvent.Mask</code> now contains the state of modifiers and mouse buttons regardless of the global hook type
(keyboard, mouse, or both).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Running global hooks won't be garbage-collected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting libuiohook logs on Mac Catalyst applications was fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The issue with global hooks breaking Alt codes on Windows was fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Getting events for Caps Lock was fixed on macOS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disabling access to the Accessibility API when a global hook is running on macOS won't freeze the OS anymore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disposing a <code>TaskPoolGlobalHook</code> inside an event handler doesn't throw an exception anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="platform-support-1">Platform Support</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for Mac Catalyst was added which makes it possible to use SharpHook in .NET MAUI apps on macOS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minimum .NET Framework version was bumped to 4.6.2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for Windows on Arm32 was removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="breaking-changes-1">Breaking Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Almost all <code>KeyCode</code> values were changed. New codes were added and some were removed. The actual enum values are
meaningless and may be changed again in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>MouseWheelEventData</code> doesn't contain <code>Amount</code> anymore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mouse wheel simulation doesn't accept the amount anymore. Instead it accepts the scroll direction and type which
makes it possible to simulate horizontal scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The meaning of the mouse wheel rotation value was changed - a positive value indicates that the wheel is rotated up or
left, and a negative value indicates that the wheel is rotated down or right.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>KeyboardEventData.KeyChar</code> was renamed to <code>KeyboardEventData.RawKeyChar</code> and the <code>KeyboardEventData.KeyChar</code> property
was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>LogEntryParser</code> is now a singleton and doesn't have a public constructor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The constants in the <code>MouseWheelScrollDirection</code> enum were shortened: <code>VerticalDirection</code> to <code>Vertical</code> and
<code>HorizontalDirection</code> to <code>Horizontal</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="new-features-1">New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Text entry simulation was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low-level functionality providers were added - they can be used instead of directly using the <code>UioHook</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Horizontal mouse wheel simulation is now possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Classes which help with testing were added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reactive global hook can now accept a default scheduler which will be used for all observables.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extension methods for <code>SharpHook.Native.ModifierMask</code> were added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes-1">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Global hooks can now be created and disposed multiple times on Windows without problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many key code mappings to OS-specific key codes were fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>KeyTyped</code> events are now better at determining which characters should be produced by key presses on Windows.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>The ability to simulate mouse press/release events at the current coordinates was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Turns out that libuiohook has always ignored mouse coordinates when simulating mouse wheel events, so the method
which simulates them without coordinates was added, and the previous one was marked as obsolete.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>.NET 7 support was added and <code>[LibraryImport]</code> is used instead of <code>[DllImport]</code> on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explicit targets for .NET 5 and .NET Core 3.1 were removed, though the library can be used on those platforms through
.NET Standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>HookEventArgs</code> now contains the <code>SuppressEvent</code> property instead of <code>Reserved</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>KeyboardEventData.KeyChar</code> is now of type <code>ushort</code> instead of <code>char</code> - this was changed purely for marshalling
reasons and it should still be used as a <code>char</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simulating mouse presses and releases now requires providing mouse pointer coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ability to make <code>RunAsync</code> create a background thread was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>KeyCode.VcPrintscreen</code> was renamed to <code>KeyCode.VcPrintScreen</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Versioned libuiohook binaries for macOS and Linux were removed from the NuGet package as they were bit-for-bit same as
the unversioned binaries.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SharpHook now uses a build of libuiohook which links the C runtime statically on Windows. This means that Visual C++
Redistributable is not needed for client apps to run (the logging functionality is a exception though).
(<a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook/issues/14">#14</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>EmptyLogSource</code> class was added, mostly for using it instead of <code>LogSource</code> in release builds of client apps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A memory issue which was fixed for hooks in v3.0.1 was fixed for logging as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Windows x86 support was fixed (<a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook/issues/10">#10</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The functions in <code>UioHook</code> which return system properties now return <code>int</code> instead of <code>long</code>. This is a tiny breaking
change, but I believe it's too small to warrant a bump of the major (or even minor) version.</p>
